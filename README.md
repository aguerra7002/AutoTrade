# AutoTrade
This software is a ground up automatic cryptocurrency trader whose end goal is to trade on the Binance exchange in hopes of making profit. Various trading algorithms are being implemented to trade, with their performance being tested on the platform in a quick and simple manner. A small paper whose recent edition can be found in the repo describes these algorithms in more detail.
